already coded:
--------------
B:
- smite: not sure whether it is worth using? training invo just for this seems bad
- recall:
  - currently used whenever at full MP
  - maybe shouldn't be used as much though
- wait around for allies to heal before exploring
- water walking means we don't worry about fumbling in shallow water
- special code for joining from a priest
- allies might make coward_step strats worse? need to think about this more
C:
- first two abilities: not sure whether worth using
- slouch:
  - complicated logic estimating how much damage it does
  - don't want to use this too much because then we lose stat boosts,
    so only using it at 6* for now
- step out of time: not sure whether it is worth training invo up for this since it is a bit tricky to use
- slow movement might make tactical steps worse? need to think about this more
- don't use haste, speed weapons, etc
- train Invo up a little for slouch fail rate
H:
- renames ally to "elliptic"
- uses recall when it can't see a friendly elliptic
- uses remember life at 2*, currently chooses randomly
- not currently using idealise or transference, so faith/invocations not very useful
L:
- very minimally coded in order to win DDAK, abandons in midgame
M:
- minor destruction: might be worth implementing as a replacement for throwing
- major destruction: used for hydras currently, a bit tricky to use in general
- lesser servant: should probably use this sometimes, especially before greater servant is safe
  - use before harder battles?
  - not as good on DD or at low HP
  - don't use if a servant is in sight (or if used recently?)
- greater servant: currently used on BiA monsters or at low HP
  - use before harder battles?
  - not as good on DD or at low HP
  - don't use if a servant is it sight (or if used recently?)
  - teleport away from hostile servants
  - don't teleport with a friendly servant around?
- train Invo up fairly high for greater servant fail
- special DD logic
O:
- heroism:
  - we use this in basically every battle of significance
  - don't use if already active
- finesse:
  - use before hard battles (currently looking at BiA list)
  - don't use if already active
- train Invo up a decent amount for heroism duration and finesse fail
- stop training most skills at 22 because of heroism
Q:
- upheaval:
  - similar to major destruction but easier to target and more reliable
  - not sure exactly what the best way is of using this, but we probably should
- elemental force:
  - a bit tricky to use because need to count nearby clouds
  - use before hard battles?
  - don't use if can see friendly elementals?
- disaster area:
  - pretty tricky to use because of the open space requirements
  - creating lava might get qw in trouble too?
- probably should use some subset of the abilities and train invo for them, but I'm not sure exactly
- extra SH and RMsl might make using a 2-hander more competitive?
- coward abilities might be bad with Q noise, not sure
R:
- sacrifice logic: preferences given by total ordering on set of possible sacrifices (including reject sacrifices)
  - doesn't handle the multioption sacrifices very intelligently currently
- jump ability: should maybe use this to blink to stairs sometimes
- healing: uses this in place of heal wounds sometimes (complicated logic)
- apocalypse:
  - use on very hard monsters
  - don't use if too drained
- special DD logic
- doesn't handle blink/paralyzed (from Ru retaliation) monsters very well at the moment
T:
- berserk:
  - use on hard monsters or when injured
  - monsters need to be close
- trog's hand:
  - use against MR-checking monsters
  - also to rest quickly in some locations (orb run, abyss, maybe should do this on zot:5 or V:5 too?)
  - don't use when already in effect
- BiA:
  - use on very hard monsters or when a berserk fails
  - don't use if a friendly BiA is already there
  - only use at 4* when really necessary
  - don't teleport with a berserk friendly BiA in sight?
- special DD logic
- weapon gifts should maybe mean that enchant weapon shouldn't be wasted on weak stuff as much?
U:
- train invocations skill similar to fighting
- use grand finale sometimes, but this is awkward because I can't see the fail rate currently
X:
- nothing special at the moment, I imagine it doesn't handle chaos cloud trail very well
Y:
- ally logic is similar to Beogh
- pain mirror (not currently used):
  - use against very hard enemies?
  - might waste too much piety
- drain life:
  - we check monster susceptibility and only use this when a lot of monsters are in sight
- special DD logic with drain life
- we train invo up a bit for drain life, but maybe we should raise it higher?
- coward_step stuff might be worse with allies, as with Beogh
- we avoid using holy weapons
1: (this is the old plan, not sure what ended up happening)
- could use SH ability (3 MP), but not sure... is using heroism logic for this reasonable? it isn't as good of course, and I don't know how much piety it uses
- cleansing flame (5 MP) - strong with high invo against some things, but probably don't use it for now
- divine warrior (8 MP) - can use this with similar logic to SGD/BiA I guess
- holy branding - can use on demon weapons to make them usable I guess, though I'll just be using axes for now
- things that qw should know about TSO:
  - dislikes some items (venom/pain/vamp brands, demon weapons, obsidian axe, ?)
  - halo effectively gives SInv at 2* piety
  - dislikes stabs ("This attack would place you under penance" etc) 
    - can automatically answer no to this prompt, but that might cause some issues?
  - altar name might require special case

should code:
------------

might code:
-----------
E: pacified monster handling might be annoying, though could just not use the ability
J: altar availability makes this not that attractive to code
Z: recite and sanctuary usage might be tricky

not coding for now:
-----------
A: curse logic is hard
D: stabby is hard
F: these abilities are a bit tricky and I don't know the god very well
G: these abilities are a bit tricky and food might be an issue
K: casty is hard
N: decks are complicated and use up lots of inventory
S: casty is hard
V: casty is hard
